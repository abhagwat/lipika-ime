Lipika IME is a many-to-many, user configurable, input method engine. Originally, designed for typing Sanskrit using Devanagari on a Mac. It can be configured to work with other Indo-European languages of similar structure.

Contriants of the current version include:
1. Support for only one class and wildcard per mapping
2. Class mapping has to always be a suffix the algorithm does not backtrack
